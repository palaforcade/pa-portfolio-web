        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="resume-main__section">
            <p>
                Currently pursuing a Master's in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, I have a
                diverse portfolio of experiences, including software engineering and cloud operations in the industry,
                as well as my current position as a data science research assistant for Stanford’s Lucile Packard
                Children’s Hospital. My journey has equipped me with skills in product strategy, UX/UI design, agile
                project management, and technical architecture. Explore my full resume to learn more about my commitment
                to creating transformative products and my contributions to the tech world.

                <div class="section-dates">September 2023 - Present</div>
                <p>
                    As a Data Engineering Research Assistant, I collaborate with the Stanford MS&E department to enhance
                    operations at Stanford’s Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital. I am involved in two key projects:

                    <li>
                        <u>SWIM (Simulation for Whole Institution Modelling):</u> This project simulates patient flow
                        within
                        the
                        hospital to inform capacity planning decisions, both short-term (one day) and long-term
                        (multiple
                        years). Over the past year, I have optimized the model by parallelizing its execution using
                        Monte
                        Carlo Simulation principles, reducing execution times by a factor of four. I also led the
                        transformation of the model into a comprehensive internal tool now seamlessly used by executives
                        for
                        capacity planning.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <u>Remote Monitoring of Newly Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes Patients:</u> I have designed an
                        integrated
                        dashboard to include activity metrics in the remote monitoring of these patients. This dashboard
                        is
                        currently being deployed in production, aiming to establish a new standard of care. It
                        incorporates
                        actionable metrics that enable clinical staff to better understand patients' needs and
                        specificities, thereby delivering more precise care.

                <h3>Freelance Product Manager</h3>
                <div class="section-company">Mon Logement BRS</div>
                <div class="section-dates">June 2023 - December 2023</div>
                <p>
                    As a freelance product manager, I undertook a comprehensive project for a client seeking to develop
                    a
                    B2C
                    mobile application aimed at managing real estate under specific French government programs. This
                    project
                    involved several key phases and deliverables:

                    <li>
                        <u>Design and Architecture:</u> I designed the full user interface (UI) and technical
                        architecture of the
                        application. This process began with extensive client consultations to gather feedback and
                        understand
                        their needs and requirements thoroughly.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <u>User Stories and Development Management:</u> To streamline the development process, I created
                        detailed
                        user
                        stories that outlined the functional requirements and user interactions with the application.
                        They
                        served as a roadmap for the engineering team, ensuring that each feature was developed according
                        to
                        the
                        client's specifications and industry best practices.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <u>Team Leadership and Product Delivery:</u> I led a team of two engineers throughout the
                        development
                        phase,
                        providing guidance and ensuring alignment with the project goals. My leadership involved regular
                        check-ins with the engineering team and the client, as well as ensuring continuous integration
                        and
                        technical excellence in terms of code quality and infrastructure robustness.

                    <li>
                        <u></u>Feature Design and Implementation:</u> I led the design and implementation of a major
                        feature,
                        guiding
                        it
                        from initial concept through to its deployment in production. This process included coordinating
                        with
                        multiple stakeholders to ensure the feature met all functional and performance requirements.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <u>ISO 27001 Cloud Security Management System:</u> I coordinated the implementation of an ISO
                        27001
                        Cloud
                        Security Management System, overseeing the project from the initial audit to the successful
                        certification. This involved managing both the technical adjustments and the compliance
                        documentation
                        required to meet the ISO standards.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <u>Cloud Infrastructure Scaling:</u> I managed the update of the cloud infrastructure to
                        accommodate a
                        rapid
                        user growth of 50% per month. This task required enhancing system scalability and reliability to
                        handle
                        increased loads without compromising on performance or security.

                        <u>MVP Development:</u> I conceived and developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a mobile
                        app
                        called
                        Rider's Coffee, aimed at connecting outdoor enthusiasts for various activities, including rides
                        and
                        hikes. The development process involved designing key features that would engage users and
                        facilitate the organization of outdoor events, ensuring the platform was intuitive and
                        user-friendly.

                    <li>
                        <u>Concept Validation and Iteration:</u> To validate the concept, I engaged directly with
                        potential
                        clients, gathering extensive feedback on the MVP. This feedback was crucial in iterating and
                        refining the app, focusing on enhancing user experience.
